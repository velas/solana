# Building

## **1. Install rustc, cargo and rustfmt.**

```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
$ rustup component add rustfmt
```

Please sure you are always using the latest stable rust version by running:

```bash
$ rustup update
```

On Linux systems you may need to install libssl-dev, pkg-config, zlib1g-dev, etc.  On Ubuntu:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libudev-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev llvm clang
```

## **2. Download the source code.**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/velas/velas-chain.git
$ cd velas-chain
```

## **3. Build.**

```bash
$ cargo build
```

## **4. Run a minimal local cluster.**
```bash
$ ./run.sh
```

# Testing

**Run the test suite:**

```bash
$ cargo test
```

### EVM integration
Info about EVM integration is at our [docs](https://docs.next.velas.com/evm).

### Starting a local devnet
Start your own devnet locally, instructions are in the [online docs](https://docs.next.velas.com/cluster/bench-tps).

### Accessing the remote devnet
* `devnet` - public devnet accessible via bootstrap.next.velas.com.

# Benchmarking

First install the nightly build of rustc. `cargo bench` requires use of the
unstable features only available in the nightly build.

```bash
$ rustup install nightly
```

Run the benchmarks:

```bash
$ cargo +nightly bench
```
